# MyNSB 4 Android
### A mobile app targeting students @ NSB

1. __Notifications__<br>
Students will be able to receive notifications about school events such as Mufti Days. A list of recent notifications and upcoming events will be available through the app.

2. __Offline access__<br>
Offline access will allow students to view the app at any time, making it more convenient. An internet connection will be required to receive new notifications.

3. __Sporting venues__<br>
Notifications for weekly sport venues are also a possible feature to be included in the app. Students can select their sport and the app will notify them of the venue.

4. __StudyGroups__<br>
Integration with StudyGroups will allow students and mentors to organise their meetings. Students can also view available StudyGroups that they can join.

5. __Bell times__<br>
Students can view bell times and choose to be notified a few minutes before the bell is scheduled to ring.

6. __Diary/Timetable__<br>
In order to avoid clashing with the Intranet and Skedular, this feature will be determined based on how many people would like to use it and may not end up as a feature of the app.
